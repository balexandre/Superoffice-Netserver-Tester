            <remarks>
            The ExpiringDictionary generic class provides a mapping from a set of keys to a set of values. Each addition to the ExpiringDictionary consists of a value and its associated key. Retrieving a value by using its key is very fast, close to O(1), because the ExpiringDictionary class is implemented with an internal Dictionary witch is implemented as a hash table.
            <c>Note</c>  
            The speed of retrieval depends on the quality of the hashing algorithm of the type specified for TKey. 
            As long as an object is used as a key in the ExpiringDictionary, it must not change in any way that affects its hash value. Every key in an ExpiringDictionary must be unique according to the ExpiringDictionary's equality comparer. A key cannot be a null reference, but a value can be, if the value type TValue is a reference type.
            ExpiringDictionary requires an equality implementation to determine whether keys are equal. You can specify an implementation of the IEqualityComparer generic interface by using a constructor that accepts a comparer parameter; if you do not specify an implementation, the default generic equality comparer EqualityComparer.Default is used. If type TKey implements the System.IEquatable generic interface, the default equality comparer uses that implementation.
            The capacity of an ExpiringDictionary is the number of elements the ExpiringDictionary can hold. In this implementation, the default initial capacity for an ExpiringDictionary is 3; however, that default might change in future versions of the .NET Framework. As elements are added to an ExpiringDictionary, the capacity is automatically increased as required by reallocating the internal array.

            You can also use the Item property to add new elements by setting the value of a key that does not exist in the ExpiringDictionary; for example, myExpiringDictionary[myKey] = myValue. However, if the specified key already exists in the ExpiringDictionary, setting the Item property overwrites the old value. In contrast, the Add method throws an exception if a value with the specified key already exists.
            If the Count property value already equals the capacity, the capacity of the ExpiringDictionary is increased by automatically reallocating the internal array, and the existing elements are copied to the new array before the new element is added.
            A key cannot be a null reference, but a value can be, if TValue is a reference type.
            If Count is less than the capacity, this method approaches an O(1) operation. If the capacity must be increased to accommodate the new element, this method becomes an O(n) operation, where n is Count.

            Count also includes elements that has expired but is not yet removed by the timer function.
            The capacity of an ExpiringDictionary is the number of elements that the ExpiringDictionary can store. The Count property is the number of elements that are actually in the ExpiringDictionary.
            The capacity is always greater than or equal to Count. If Count exceeds the capacity while adding elements, the capacity is increased by automatically reallocating the internal array before copying the old elements and adding the new elements.

            </remarks>
            <example>
            The method implementing the asynchronous operation needs to implement the delegate <see cref="T:System.ComponentModel.AsyncOperation"/>:
            <code>
            private void MyAsyncOperation(AsyncContext context, object argument)
            {
            	// Do some stuff...
            }
            </code>
            The argument passed to the method is an optional argument selected when spawning off the asynchronous task:
            <code>
            AsyncContext ctx = ThreadManager.SpawnThread(new AsyncOperation(MyAsyncOperation), argument );
            </code>

            some concrete behaviour, such as boldface, coloured font or whatever.

            ExecuteWork is called by the thread delegates provided by the various

            		A local application is an application that does something for 
            		one user.  The application starts of by authenticating the 
            		user and provides some functionality to him.  On completion, 
            		the user will log out.  The entire time the application 
            		provides functionality to the user, there is a valid session 
            		on behalf of this user.

            		A server-side application serves several users.  Users are 
            		performing operations or requests.  There is a valid session 
            		for the user while he is performing the operation and the 
            		session is suspended between operations.  An example of this 
            		is a web application.  The user clicks something on the 
            		browser and sends off a request to the server.  While the 
            		server is processing the request, the session is valid.  
            		Between the requests, the session is suspended.

            The first operation performed against NetServer in a local application 
            will be to <see cref="M:SuperOffice.SoSession.Authenticate"/> and the last will be to 
            <see cref="M:SuperOffice.SoSession.Close"/> the session.  The session object will not be used

            In a server-side application, the user will be authenticated, by an 
            underlying call to the <see cref="M:SuperOffice.SoSession.Authenticate"/> method.  As each request is 
            completed, a <see cref="M:SuperOffice.SoSession.Suspend"/> should be called.  As the next request starts, the 
            suspended session will be continued using the <see cref="M:SuperOffice.SoSession.Continue(System.String)"/> method.
            </para>
            <para>
            The suspend method returns a string that represents the 
            authenticated user.  This string should be stored in the web-
            applications session-state.  As it is needed for a continuation of 
            the session, it should be fetched back from the web-applications 
            session-state.  
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="M:SuperOffice.SoSession.Suspend"/> method will return a <see cref="T:SuperOffice.Security.Principal.SoCredentials"/> object, serialized 
            and decrypted using 
            <see cref="M:SuperOffice.Security.Principal.Private.PrincipalHelper.SerializeCredentials(SuperOffice.Security.Principal.SoCredentials)"/>.  
            the <see cref="M:SuperOffice.SoSession.Continue(System.String)"/> method will use 
            <see cref="M:SuperOffice.Security.Principal.Private.PrincipalHelper.DeserializeCredentials(System.String)"/>

            Check if two arrays have the same contents. The arrays must be of the same type, and the 
            base type must be comparable so that it can be sorted. The algorithm is O(log n) if the arrays
            have the same size, otherwise it is very fast.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Type inference means that you do not have to explicitly specify the actual type, simply
            pass in two arrays.
            <example>
            This example shows how:
            <code>
            int[] allAssocs = AssociateCache.GetCurrent().GetAssociateIds();
            int[] myAssocs = { 1, 2, 3 };
            bool areMyAllThereAre = SuperOffice.Util.ArraysEquivalent( allAssocs, myAssocs );

            <param name="val">Inner list value for the given key</param>
            <example>
            Suppose we have to store a number of values for each key. A normal dictionary is unique on key, so
            we need to store the values in a list inside each dictionary value.
            <p/>
            The declaration can look like this:
            <code>
            		private static Dictionary&lt;SoTable, List&lt;CTData&gt;&gt; _cachedTables;"
            </code>
            To add a new CTData using some SoTable type key, use the following:
            <code>
            	SoTable key = GetSoTable( mySomething );
            	CTData listValue = new CTData( myDataSomething );
            	CollectionOps.AddToDictionaryList( _cachedTables, key, listValue );
            </code>
            If the key already exists, its value list is extended with the new value. If not,
            then the key is added to the dictionary and a new list containing the single new listValue is set as its value.

            The ToString() method of the NameValueCollection class CANNOT BE used to create the string. 
            The framework claims that Request.QueryString is a NameValueCollection, but at runtime, it's actually a System.Web.HttpValueCollection. 
            The difference is significant because HttpValueCollection.ToString() returns the URL-encoded raw query string, 
            but NameValueCollection.ToString() returns the default Object.ToString() result - 
            in this case "System.Collections.Specialized.NameValueCollection"

            Equivalent nodes appear only once in the output. Two element nodes are treated equivalent if: their local names are equal,

            content is equal. The same rule applies for comments and processing instructions.

            is to allocate 10 items at a time, which is usually good enough

            This class provides a queue implementation for the queued asynchronous execution
            strategy, that gives us one single queue for the whole NetServer instance.   See remarks
            for important information on execution context!
            <remarks>
            *** NOTE *** on Context: The AsyncContext that is associated with the executing thread is based on the
            context of the thread that started it. Since this is not predictable, and may change (if the queue empties),
            you CANNOT ASSUME that the execution context for any unit of work is that of the calling (client) thread!
            <para/>
            Therefore, this execution model should only be used if the context is not relevant - that may not be so often.

            This class is an encapsulation of the Windows Performance Counters. Use the static Increment/Decrement methods
            combined with the Counters enum to do your counting. All public methods are thread safe.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Performance counter categories cannot be edited, i.e., you cannot add a new counter to an already existing category.
            At the same time, enumerating all counters to see if they match the current definitions in the code takes a loooong
            time, there is some kind of timeout or hangup in there.
            <para/>
            Therefore, you must set the CreateCounters property to true in the Diagnostics section of the config file, and run once
            to re-create all categories, if you run for the first time or have changed/added to the counter definitions.
            <para/>
            To add a new counter, you need to do several things: 1) Add a new member to the <see cref="T:SuperOffice.Exceptions.PerformanceMonitoring.Counters"/> enum.
            2) Add corresponding cases or switches (if new category) to the <see cref="M:SuperOffice.Exceptions.PerformanceMonitoring.CounterEnumFromCategoryAndName(System.String,System.String)"/>,
            to bind the enum to a category and counter name. Finally, you must add counter creation data to the 
            <see cref="M:SuperOffice.Exceptions.PerformanceMonitoring.CreateCountersForThreading"/> or other creation method (make a new one for a new category); this is where you
            set up the counter name, help and type information that is needed by the system and shown in Perfmon.

            datetime columns will have a DateTime, and columns that represent enumerations or statuses - where the

            This class implements a two-way associate container, that is, a dictionary-like collection that is indexable

            <summary>
            Helper class for impersonation, suitable for the 'using' keyword.
            </summary>
            <example>
            To use this class, simply do the following:
            <code>
            using( new FileImpersonationContext )
            {
            	// we are now the correct user to access the document archive files, log folder etc
            }
            // we are now back to the original NetServer user
            </code>
            This way of impersonation is guaranteed to return to the original user, also
            during exception handling - thereby avoiding a potential security hole.

            Documents on the Activities section tab can be checked in the background. The availability of a specified document plug-in and of each individual document is checked. This may happen at the cost of server capacity. Alternatively, documents are checked when the user enables the right-click menu. It will then take longer for a document to open, since it first has to be checked. The default is ON.

            Verification is  done by adding a progid string to the sentry plugin attribute, so that

            <remarks>
            This mechanism is more general than [SentryAddonNames] - it applies to all dynamic loaded 
            assemblies in NetServer. 
            Missing any one these required assemblies will cause NetServer to fail. The regexp is used 
            to match against the loaded assemblies full names (including version and strongname). This 
            allows a preference to match more than one possible name. Using the full name allows a 
            preference to match a strong name, so that it is harder to fake out with a dummy 
            replacement assembly.

             A SerializationWriter instance is used to store values and objects in a byte array.
            
             Once an instance is created, use the various methods to store the required data.
             ToArray() will return a byte[] containing all of the data required for deserialization.
             This can be stored in the SerializationInfo parameter in an ISerializable.GetObjectData() method.
             <para/>
             As an alternative to ToArray(), if you want to apply some post-processing to the serialized bytes, 
             such as compression, call AppendTokenTables first to ensure that the string and object token tables 
             are appended to the stream, and then cast BaseStream to MemoryStream. You can then access the
             MemoryStream's internal buffer as follows:
             <para/>
             <example><code>
             writer.AppendTokenTables();
             MemoryStream stream = (MemoryStream) writer.BaseStream;
            	serializedData = MiniLZO.Compress(stream.GetBuffer(), (int) stream.Length);
             </code></example>

            Any other object be stored using a .Net Binary formatter but this should 
            only be allowed as a last resort:
            Since this is effectively a different serialization session, there is a 
            possibility of the same shared object being serialized twice or, if the 
            object has a reference directly or indirectly back to the parent object, 
            there is a risk of looping which will throw an exception.
            
            The type of object is checked with the most common types being checked first.
            Each 'section' can be reordered to provide optimum speed but the check for
            null should always be first and the default serialization always last.
            
            Once the type is identified, a SerializedType byte is stored in the stream
            followed by the data for the object (certain types/values may not require
            storage of data as the SerializedType may imply the value).
            
            For certain objects, if the value is within a certain range then optimized
            storage may be used. If the value doesn't meet the required optimization
            criteria then the value is stored directly.
            The checks for optimization may be disabled by setting the OptimizeForSize
            property to false in which case the value is stored directly. This could 
            result in a slightly larger stream but there will be a speed increate to
            compensate.

            All other strings are stored in a string token list:
            
            The TypeCode representing the current string token list is written first (1 byte), 
            followed by the string token itself (1-4 bytes)
            
            When the current string list has reached 128 values then a new string list
            is generated and that is used for generating future string tokens. This continues
            until the maximum number (128) of string lists is in use, after which the string 
            lists are used in a round-robin fashion.
            By doing this, more lists are created with fewer items which allows a smaller 
            token size to be used for more strings.
            
            The first 16,384 strings will use a 1 byte token.
            The next 2,097,152 strings will use a 2 byte token. (This should suffice for most uses!)
            The next 268,435,456 strings will use a 3 byte token. (My, that is a lot!!)
            The next 34,359,738,368 strings will use a 4 byte token. (only shown for completeness!!!)

            Returns a byte[] containing all of the serialized data.
            
            The current implementation has the data in 3 sections:
            1) A 4 byte Int32 giving the offset to the 3rd section.
            2) The main serialized data.
            3) The serialized string tokenization lists and object
               tokenization lists.
            
            Only call this method once all of the data has been serialized.
            
            This method appends all of the tokenized data (string and object)
            to the end of the stream and ensures that the first four bytes
            reflect the offset of the tokenized data so that it can be
            deserialized first.
            This is the reason for requiring a rewindable stream.
            
            Future implementations may also allow the serialized data to be
            accessed via 2 byte[] arrays. This would remove the requirement
            for a rewindable stream opening the possibility of streaming the
            serialized data directly over the network allowing simultaneous
            of partially simultaneous deserialization.

            <summary>
            Gets or Sets a boolean flag to indicate whether to preserve the scale within
            a Decimal value when it would have no effect on the represented value.
            Note: a 2m value and a 2.00m value represent the same value but internally they 
            are stored differently - the former has a value of 2 and a scale of 0 and
            the latter has a value of 200 and a scale of 2. 
            The scaling factor also preserves any trailing zeroes in a Decimal number. 
            Trailing zeroes do not affect the value of a Decimal number in arithmetic or 
            comparison operations. However, trailing zeroes can be revealed by the ToString 
            method if an appropriate format string is applied.
            From a serialization point of view, the former will take 2 bytes whereas the 
            latter would take 4 bytes, therefore it is preferable to not save the scale where
            it doesn't affect the represented value.

            Table right is a combination of bits representing permissions on a row.  
            Logical bitwise operations has to be performed using the

            <remarks>
            Delete and Insert permissions are straight forward, represented with one bit each.  Read and Update permissions
            are more complex as they have a three-state represented with two bits.  The rules for both of them are identical 
            and they are explained using Read as an example:
            <para>
            Read means full read access, FilteredRead means that some of
            the fields can be read, but not all.  The combination of these two bits (i.e. Read | FilteredRead) is an
            illegal state.  As Read is a Right with higher access than FilteredRead,
            the bitwise arithmetic becomes somewhat complex: <c>Read &amp; Read -&gt; Read</c>,
            <c>Read &amp; FilteredRead -&gt; FilteredRead</c>, <c>FilteredRead &amp; FilteredRead
            -&gt; FilteredRead</c>, <c>Read | Read -&gt; Read</c>, <c>Read | FilteredRead -&gt; Read</c> and
            <c>FilteredRead | FilteredRead -&gt; FilteredRead</c>.

            For example: FieldRight defines Read+Write+Mandatory rights on a field.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Get fresh rights from the <see cref="!:PrivateSentryAgentFactory"/>, where they are made to order.
            Rights are read-only, static objects. You cannot modify a field-right or table right object.
            This is because a field-right object may be a shared instance, so modifying it will modify all fields, 
            not just one.

            <summary>
            Helper class for performing a Visitor-type invocation of methods on some node structure
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern for a description of the Visitor pattern.
            Visitor is a fairly abstract pattern and will usually require some thought to follow through.
            <para/>
            The <see cref="!:VisitorPatternHelper"/> class performs the dispatching/invocation of visitor methods,
            so the client class only needs to provide methods that handle the required types of nodes in 
            the visited structure.
            <para/>
            Generally the client class will provide a class instance that contains one or more Visit methods. It will
            then call the <see cref="M:SuperOffice.Util.VisitorPatternHelper`1.InvokeStrictVisitor(System.Object[])"/> or <see cref="M:SuperOffice.Util.VisitorPatternHelper`1.InvokeTolerantVisitor(System.Object[])"/> method, giving
            the root node of some structure to be visited as the input parameter(s).
            <para/>
            The VisitorPatternHelper will reflect on the client class and try to find a method whose signature
            matches the input. If it finds one, it will forward the call to this method, which may recursively
            call one of the InvokeXXXVisitor methods in turn.

             <remarks>
             We use the anglic pronounciation, rather than the native version because this catches
             some useful almost-matches (SCHMIDT and SMITH for example).
             
             Single initials are concatenated together as a single word, so that
             * A.C. Nielsen == AC Nielsen  != ACNielsen
             * I.B.M == IBM
            
             There is no _length restriction on the returned code, although the upper bound
             is obviously (num-of-words)*5, since each word's metaphone code is 5 chars long.
            
             * SuperOffice ASA   = SPRFSAS

            Utility class for collecting stack traces - useful when you want to make debugging easier by collecting
            run-time data on where your classes get called from. Enabled by EnableScaffolding AND EnableStackTracing,
            which default to FALSE (EnableStackTracing defaults to TRUE in DEBUG builds).

            <remarks>
            StackTracer has been implemented in the TableInfo base class, because it can be infuriatingly hard to discover
            who allocated a certain ContactTableInfo or whatever when you start getting unwanted cross joins. This example is 
            taken from the TableInfo class:

            This is a helper class designed to encode, parse and reformat culturally sensitive data types between
            an application server without culture knowledge, and a front-end with such knowledge.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The problem: The application server does not know the culture of the current client. At the same time,
            we need to be able to include culturally sensitive data (such as a date) as part of a tooltip or other
            server-side generated text. Before displaying this text to the user, culturally sensitive elements need 
            to be parsed and reformatted to the correct culture.
            <para/>
            The methods in this class take care of both sides of this process. The Encode methods, such as 
            <see cref="M:SuperOffice.CRM.Globalization.CultureDataFormatter.EncodeDate(System.DateTime)"/>, take a native data type as input and return a string that contains both
            a specification of what it is (a date) and the value formatted in the invariant culture.
            <para/>
            The <see cref="M:SuperOffice.CRM.Globalization.CultureDataFormatter.LocalizeEncoded(System.String)"/> method will take such a formatted element, and by calling on the
            proper LocalFormat method (such as <see cref="M:SuperOffice.CRM.Globalization.CultureDataFormatter.LocalFormatDate(System.DateTime)"/>, return it in its correct form according
            to the current culture settings for the thread.

            Helper class for impersonation, suitable for the 'using' keyword.
            </summary>
            <example>
            To use this class, simply do the following:
            <code>
            using( new FileImpersonationContext )
            {
            	// we are now the correct user to access the document archive files, log folder etc
            }
            // we are now back to the original NetServer user
            </code>
            This way of impersonation is guaranteed to return to the original user, also
            during exception handling - thereby avoiding a potential security hole.

            IMPORTANT:<para/>
            Avoid reading directly from configurationfile like this;
            	<code>_values = (NameValueCollection)ConfigurationSettings.GetConfig("SuperOffice/Security/Sentry");</code>

            This enables the code to check for missing configuration files, and missing xml sections,
            thus, enabling the code to throw appropriate exceptions.

            Intellisync Server authenticates against Intellisync Connector.  When an Intellisync Server sync session for a 
            particular user is ended, the authentication session is always removed.  When a synchronization session 
            exceeds the this time-out, an error is returned to Intellisync Server.  Intellisync Server will then try to 
            re synchronize later.  Extensive traffic in the database resulting in a slowed up synchronization will 
            typically trigger this.  Synchronization for a normal user will seldom take more than 5 minutes (300 seconds), 
            hence the default value of 10 minutes (600 seconds) is a rather conservative value.  Situations where a lot of 
            database locks are occurring should probably result in this default value being decreased, rather than increased.  
            Extremely slow hardware as a result of virtualization should probably result in an increased value.
